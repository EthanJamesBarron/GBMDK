# GBMDK

Gang Beasts Mod Development Kit: A pre-configured Unity project that contains dummy scripts and resources for building assets for Gang Beasts mods. 
**[Requires CementGB 4.0+](https://github.com/CementGB-4-0/CementSource/releases/latest) installed on your game for map and costume creation.**

## Disclaimer

This project DOES NOT and SHOULD NOT contain vanilla Gang Beasts assets, such as audio, meshes, textures, etc. in their entirety.  
Some ripped data values are used, such as serialized MonoBehaviour field presets.  
All Gang Beasts code is stripped from the ripped scripts. These scripts must ONLY contain gizmos and other editor-specific helpers as working code.  

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
- Unity v2021.3.33f1 (``unityhub://2021.3.33f1/ee5a2aa03ab2`` (open as link in browser))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) (optional, makes things easier)

### Steps

1. Click `Code` in the top right corner of the repository contents window above
2. Download the repository either using GitHub Desktop or as a `.zip` file.
3. Once downloaded (and extracted to a folder if downloaded as `.zip`), open the folder as a Unity project in Unity Hub. This may take a while.
4. Clear the console window and make sure nothing persists. If anything does, or if you encounter script errors later on while developing, report it as a bug on the [Cement Discord](https://discord.gg/fCwXc5k43w) or on this repo's Issues page.
